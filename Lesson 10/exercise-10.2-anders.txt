What is Convolution Neural Network (CNN)?
-----------------------------------
CNN is an variant of the more simpler neural network. 

With neural network (and other commonly machine learning techniques), feature engineering is one of the most essential and important task for good classification (see (1)). Feature engineering is a very hard and complex task, which you would have to do for each type of problems (see (2)). Using CNN, feature engineering is beeing done when we train it. 
For each training, it gets better and better to filter the input for relevant information (feature engineering). 

Once we learned our hierarchical features, we can simply pass them to a fully connected, simple neural network that combines them in order to classify the input into classes(*).
