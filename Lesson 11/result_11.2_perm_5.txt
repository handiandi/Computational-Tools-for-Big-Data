Progressive Savings and Loan
Association <PRSL> said it has agreed in principle to be
purchased by Far West Financial Corp's Far West Savings and

    The acquisition would be a cash merger, with Progressive
shareholders receiving up to three dlrs per share, the company
said.
    Progressive Savings has assets of about 500 mln dlrs and
operates ten offices in Los Angeles and Orange counties.
    The agreement is subject to federal and shareholder
approval.

Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
position, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growing
capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
financial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations," he said.
    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
fund management," Smithson said.

Former Prime Minister Robert
Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.
Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.
    Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate
should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.
    "A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be
between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps
around about 48 cents," he said.
    The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and
floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.
    Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and
party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by
September, have rejected his calls for a managed float.
    He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive"
interest rates for government stock.
    "I know of no other country which is implementing such a
free floating policy," he added. "There is widespread agreement
internationally that we have no alternative to floating
currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more
effective methods of managing them so as to limit the
volatility which has caused so much concern and damage."

The average price of mexico's crude
oil exports in first quarter 1987 will be 15.25 dlrs per
barrel, according to preliminary figures issued in a press
release by the state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX).
    It gave no direct comparison with the year-ago figure but
said crude and products sales were expected to rise to 1.99
billion dlrs this quarter, 420 mln dlrs higher than expected
and 22 pct better than the year-ago quarter.
    Prospects for the second quarter were relatively favourable
with crude exports seen at 1.320 mln bpd after an expected

Hecla Mining Co said it
has agreed to purchase a 28 pct interest in the Greens Creek
Joint Venture from British Petroleum Co PLC's Amselco Minerals
Inc unit.
    The venture expects to bring into production a
gold-silver-lead-zinc ore body on Admiralty Island, Alaska,
containing about 3,500,000 short tons of ore assaying about
0.18 ounce of gold, 24.0 ounces of silver, 9.7 pct zinc and 3.9
pct zinc per short ton, Hecla said.  It said there is
significant potential for the discovery of additional ore.
    Hecla said initial production from a trackless underground
mine is scheduled for late 1988 at a rate of about 1,000 tons
or ore per day.  "At this rate, the Greens Creek mine will be
the largest domestic silver mine and is expected to be one of
the lowest cost producers."
    The company said it estimates its total investment in the
project, including its share of preproduction costs, at about
45 mln dlrs, to be funded through internally generated cash and
existing lines of credit.  It said Amselco will retain a
majority interest in the project.  Other interest holders are
CSX Corp <CSX> and <Exaias Resources Corp>.
