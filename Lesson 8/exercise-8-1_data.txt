about one and a half medium-sized avocadoes 
one dl cold pressed coconut oil in liquid form but not really warm
at least half a fruit's worth of lemon juice
three tbsp powdered sugar, less or more if needed
arbitrary amount of vanilla something 
a bit of corn starch probably not necessary, I just freaked and thought it's not going to be sufficiently solid but the mix just wasn't cool enough at that point
Mix in a blender until smooth and creamy, then let it cool in the fridge for a little while so the coconut oil starts to solidify before frosting. The cupcakes should probably be frozen unless eaten within a couple of days.
