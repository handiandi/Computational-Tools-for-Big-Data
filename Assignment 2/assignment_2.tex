\section{Exercise 5.1}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Establish connection to the Northwind database in Python with Sqlite (use the sqlite3 module) and MongoDB. Document the connection by making some simple queries.}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We import the needed modules for Sqlite and MongoDB
  \item Then we create two queries for Sqlite and print the results
  \item Last, we do the same with MongoDB: create two queries and print the results\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 5/exercise5-1.py"}
~\\
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
sqlite query:
customers:
 [('ALFKI', 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders', 'Sales Representative', 'Obere Str. 57', 
 'Berlin', None, '12209', 'Germany', '030-0074321', '030-0076545')]
Orders: 
 (10643, 'ALFKI', 6, '1997-08-25 00:00:00.000', '1997-09-22 00:00:00.000', 
 '1997-09-02 00:00:00.000', 1, 29.46, 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Obere Str. 57', 
 'Berlin', None, '12209', 'Germany')



mongodb query:
customers:
 {'CustomerID': 'ALFKI', 'ContactTitle': 'Sales Representative', 
 'CompanyName': 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'City': 'Berlin', 'Fax': '030-0076545', 
 'Region': 'NULL', 'ContactName': 'Maria Anders', 'Phone': '030-0074321', 
 '_id': ObjectId('56139e109348cd1026b33f5b'), 'Address': 'Obere Str. 57', 
 'Country': 'Germany', 'PostalCode': 12209}

Orders: 
 {'CustomerID': 'ALFKI', 'EmployeeID': 6, 'ShipName': 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 
 'OrderID': 10643, 'ShippedDate': '1997-09-02 00:00:00.000', 'Freight': 29.46, 
 'ShipVia': 1, 'ShipCity': 'Berlin', 'ShipAddress': 'Obere Str. 57', 
 '_id': ObjectId('56139e119348cd1026b35561'), 'ShipCountry': 'Germany', 
 'OrderDate': '1997-08-25 00:00:00.000', 'ShipRegion': 'NULL', 'ShipPostalCode': 12209, 
 'RequiredDate': '1997-09-22 00:00:00.000'}

\end{pythonOutput}

~\\
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
We first try connecting and querying the sqlite database by querying all customers as well as orders for a specific customer. We then print out the result. 
We do it all in a try-except, so it can handle errors like "database not found" or "table not found" without  currupting the db. This is usually only nessecary when insert or updating data. We have it by principle. \\
\\*
We can see by the output, that our queries works, since it gets some reasonable results. 


\section{Exercise 5.2}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Query for, and return, all orders made by ALFKI and the products they contain}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First we fetch the \ldots
  \item Then we\ldots
  \item We output \ldots\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 5/exercise5-2.py"}
~\\
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
sqlite part:
('ALFKI', 10643, 'Rössle Sauerkraut')
('ALFKI', 10643, 'Chartreuse verte')
('ALFKI', 10643, 'Spegesild')
('ALFKI', 10692, 'Vegie-spread')
('ALFKI', 10702, 'Aniseed Syrup')
('ALFKI', 10702, 'Lakkalikööri')
('ALFKI', 10835, 'Raclette Courdavault')
('ALFKI', 10835, 'Original Frankfurter grüne Soße')
('ALFKI', 10952, "Grandma's Boysenberry Spread")
('ALFKI', 10952, 'Rössle Sauerkraut')
('ALFKI', 11011, 'Escargots de Bourgogne')
('ALFKI', 11011, 'Flotemysost')

MongoDB part:
ALFKI 10643 Rössle Sauerkraut
ALFKI 10643 Chartreuse verte
ALFKI 10643 Spegesild
ALFKI 10692 Vegie-spread
ALFKI 10702 Aniseed Syrup
ALFKI 10702 Lakkalikööri
ALFKI 10835 Raclette Courdavault
ALFKI 10835 Original Frankfurter grüne Soße
ALFKI 10952 Grandma's Boysenberry Spread
ALFKI 10952 Rössle Sauerkraut
ALFKI 11011 Escargots de Bourgogne
ALFKI 11011 Flotemysost
\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
\underline{For sqlite part:}~\\
First we need to join 3 tables which are of importance to us: Orders which contain single orders for a Customer,
Order Details which ties an Order together with a Product and also contains quantity, price and discount, lastly we need the Products table to get the Product Name.
So we join Orders and Order Details on OrderID, and Order Details and Products on ProductID, and then we only need the orders with ALFKI as customer. We then specify the attributes which are interesting, for example CustomerID to ensure ALFKI is Customer, the OrderID and the different Product Names in the order.

~\\
\underline{For MongoDB part:}~\\
MongoDB version is sort of the same as the sqlite one, instead of joins we just iterate over queries of each collection with our chosen criteria 

\section{Exercise 5.3}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Get all orders (with products) made by ALFKI that contain at least 2 product types}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First we create the sqlite part, with a single query which contains a sub-select. We prints the result 
  \item Then we create the MongoDB part with loops, and printing the results. 
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
%\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 2/exercise2-2.py"}\\
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
Sqlite part:
('ALFKI', 10643, 'Rössle Sauerkraut')
('ALFKI', 10643, 'Chartreuse verte')
('ALFKI', 10643, 'Spegesild')
('ALFKI', 10702, 'Aniseed Syrup')
('ALFKI', 10702, 'Lakkalikööri')
('ALFKI', 10835, 'Raclette Courdavault')
('ALFKI', 10835, 'Original Frankfurter grüne Soße')
('ALFKI', 10952, "Grandma's Boysenberry Spread")
('ALFKI', 10952, 'Rössle Sauerkraut')
('ALFKI', 11011, 'Escargots de Bourgogne')
('ALFKI', 11011, 'Flotemysost')

MongoDB part:
ALFKI 10643 Rössle Sauerkraut
ALFKI 10643 Chartreuse verte
ALFKI 10643 Spegesild
ALFKI 10702 Aniseed Syrup
ALFKI 10702 Lakkalikööri
ALFKI 10835 Raclette Courdavault
ALFKI 10835 Original Frankfurter grüne Soße
ALFKI 10952 Grandma's Boysenberry Spread
ALFKI 10952 Rössle Sauerkraut
ALFKI 11011 Escargots de Bourgogne
ALFKI 11011 Flotemysost

\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
\underline{For sqlite part:}~\\
The solution looks very similar to the latter, except for the sub/"inner" select statement. This select retrieve ALL the order ID from Orders, which have a count greater than 1 and CustomerID is 'ALFKI'. ~\\
The outer-select, select then CustomerID, OrderID and ProductName based on those OrderID's which the inner-selects returns. 

~\\
\underline{For MongoDB part:}~\\
The solution looks very similar to the latter, except for the if-statement where the count are greater than 1. 

~\\
For verifying the result, we can see that the 10692 from the previous exercise are NOT in this solution. 10692 has only 1 products name which we can see in the previous exercise. 

\section{Exercise 5.4}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Determine how many and who ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears” (productID 7).}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First we fetch the \ldots
  \item Then we\ldots
  \item We output \ldots\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}\\
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 5/exercise5-4.py"}
~\\
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
Sqlite: 20 distinct people ordered Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears
 They are:
(2, 'Laurence Lebihan')

\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
\underline{For sqlite part:}~\\
We can select count of customerID on orders to get how many times each customer ordered a certain product and their ContactName
We join customers on orders, orders on order details and order details on products
We filter by ProductID which needs to be 7 and group by CustomerID to get distinct Customers

~\\
\underline{For MongoDB part:}~\\
In the MongoDB version we start with order details which contain the Pears Product ID
We iterate over their respective orders and the orders respective customers
We can then build a list of distinct customers which have ordered the Pears and also how many times they have ordered them 


\section{Exercise 5.5}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{How many different and which products have been ordered by customers who have also ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears”?}\\

\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
\underline{For sqlite part:}~\\
We first find the distinct customer ids of the people who've purchased Pears using the DISTINCT and procede just like in the former exercise.
Next we find all the orders orders of the customers by joining with orders, then order details joining with order details and products joining with products.
We then find the distinct products by joining the beforementioned tables again and
build a string for use with the IN keyword specifying all the customer id's whose products we are interested in.

~\\
\underline{For MongoDB part:}~\\
We first find the customers who purchased pears like in the last exercise
Next we find all the Orders and Order Details and their corresponding Products
We can then convert the list to a set to find the unique products and how many there is


\section{Exercise 5.6}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Of those products ordered by customers who have also ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears”, which one has been ordered the most (by the same set of customers).}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We first find the distinct customer ids of the people who've purchased Uncle Bob using the DISTINCT (Inner-SELECT)
  \item We find all ProductNames and frequence of them (using count), where ProductID is not Uncle Bob and where CustomerID can be found in the result from the inner-SELECT (outer-SELECT)
  \item Last, we sort by the frequence of ProductNames and limit the result to only 5 (also outer-SELECT)
  \item We output the result\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 5/exercise5-6.py"}
~\\
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
Sqlite part:
----------------
22 times was 'Jack's New England Clam Chowder' bought
22 times was 'Tarte au sucre' bought
19 times was 'Camembert Pierrot' bought
19 times was 'Raclette Courdavault' bought
18 times was 'Chang' bought

MongoDB part:
---------------
22 times was 'Tarte au sucre' bought
22 times was 'Jack's New England Clam Chowder' bought
19 times was 'Camembert Pierrot' bought
19 times was 'Raclette Courdavault' bought
18 times was 'Gnocchi di nonna Alice' bought

\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
\underline{For sqlite part:}\\
bla bla\\
~\\
\underline{For MongoDB part:}
~\\
We first find the customers who purchased Uncle Bob
Next we find all the Orders and Order Details
Then, find their corresponding Products where ProductID is not 7 (Uncle Bob)~\\

As we can see, the first 2 items of Sqlite and MondoDB result aren't in the same order. The reason is, that the both has been bought 22 times, and we don't sort the result in another way besides the frequence. \\
The same reason can be accountet for the last item on the lists. 

\section{Exercise 5.7}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{The customer with customerID ALFKI has bought a series of products. Determine which other customers have bought most of the same products (product types – 10 apples is no better than 1 apple)}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First we fetch the \ldots
  \item Then we\ldots
  \item We output \ldots\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 5/exercise5-7.py"}~\\
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
Sqlite part:
----------------
9 products was bought by RATTC
8 products was bought by HUNGO
7 products was bought by BERGS
7 products was bought by ERNSH
7 products was bought by FOLKO

MongoDB part:
---------------
9 products was bought by RATTC
8 products was bought by HUNGO
7 products was bought by BERGS
7 products was bought by VAFFE
7 products was bought by FOLKO
\end{pythonOutput}

\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
We decided to show the top 5 of customers who bought most of the same products as ALFKI. 
If there is any descrepancies between the sqlite and MongoDB output it's because seven people bought seven of the same items as ALFKI and we only include two of them in our top 5.
\underline{For sqlite part:}~\\
We have 3 SELECT clauses. Numbered from first/outer to last/most inner: (1), (2) and (3).\\
~\\
(3) collects all ProductNames ordered by the customer 'ALFKI'\\
(2) collects all customers who have ordered any of the ProductNames from (1). This is GROUP BY CustomerID and ProductName\\
(1) selects distinct CustomerID from (2) and counts it. This is GROUP BY CustomerID, ORDER BY the count and select the first 5 records\\

~\\
\underline{For MongoDB part:}~\\


%-------------- Week 6 ---------------------
\section{Exercise 6.1}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{We should make Graphstory.com/neo4j work with the northwind database and show that it works}\\

\textbf{Overview}\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item "Selects" the customer node
  \item Retrieve the customers which customerID starts with 'A'
  \item Last we return the nodes that was found
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}\\
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 6/exercise6-1-query.txt"}~\\
\textbf{Output}~\\
\includegraphics[center]{"../Lesson 6/6_1_graph"}~\\
~\\
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
By the showned output above, we can see we get four customers where one of them is the famous 'ALFKI', thus we assume our Graphstory.com/neo4j setup works. 

\section{Exercise 6.2}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{The customer with customerID ALFKI has made a number of orders containing some products. Return all the orders made by ALFKI and the products they contain.}
~\\
\textbf{Overview}\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item "Selects" the customer, Order and products nodes (nodes which have edge names ORDERS and PURCHASED) \ldots
  \item \ldots where customerID is 'ALFKI' 
  \item Lastly we return the nodes that was found
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}\\
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 6/exercise6-2-query.txt"}~\\
\textbf{Output}~\\
\includegraphics[center]{"../Lesson 6/6_2_graph"}~\\
~\\
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
We can see from the output graph, that we get a result which is quite similar to the result from week 5. This way is better for visualizing the results and to see how it is connected. ~\\

\section{Exercise 6.3}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{The customer with customerID ALFKI has made a number of orders containing some products. Return orders made by ALFKI that contain at least 2 products. Also return the products.}~\\

\textbf{Overview}\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item "Selects" the Order and Products nodes where CustomerID is 'ALFKI' in Order
  \item Then we use the 'collect' keyword, to put products in a list and then we count the products  \ldots
  \item \ldots and return the nodes, where the count is greater than 1
  \item Last we return the nodes that was found of Order and Products\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}\\
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 6/exercise6-3-query.txt"}~\\
\textbf{Output}~\\
\includegraphics[center]{"../Lesson 6/6_3_graph"}~\\
~\\
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
In this exercise, we have omitted the Customer node, as we can use the Order node's 'customerID' attribute to find the result. 


\section{Exercise 6.4}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Determine how many and who has ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears” (productID 7)}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item "Selects" the Order and Products nodes
  \item Then we use the 'collect' keyword, to put (DISTINCT) customerID in a list   
  \item We filter based on productID equal '7'
  \item Last we return the list of customerID and the length of the list (the number of customerID's)
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 6/exercise6-4-query.txt"}~\\
\textbf{Output}~\\
\includegraphics[center]{"../Lesson 6/6_4_rowGrid"}~\\
~\\
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
Also here we have omitted the Customer node, as we can use the Order node's 'customerID' attribute to find the result.
The length keyword gives us the length of the list with the customerID's, thus we find the number of customers. The list shows the customer ID's in no specific order. ~\\

\textbf{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "Selects" the Order and Products nodes
  \item Then we use the 'collect' keyword, to put (DISTINCT) customerID from customer in a list   
  \item We filter based on productID equal '7'

We chose to show the result as a table and not a graph because the question is which item have been ordered the most and thus not relational. 

\section{Exercise 6.7}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{The customer with customerID ALFKI has bought a series of products. Determine which other customers have bought most of the same products}\\
~\\
\textbf{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "Selects" the Order and Products nodes where customerID in Order is equal to 'ALFKI'
  \item Then we use the 'collect' keyword, to put all productID which 'ALFKI' has bought in a list   
  \item We the "Select" Order an Products where productID is in 'ALFKI's list of bought productID AND customerID is not 'ALFKI'
  \item We take the DISTINCT customerID and a list of Products
  \item Last we return the customerID's and the number of Products, Ordered by the number of Products\\
\end{enumerate}
~\\
\textbf{Code}
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 6/exercise6-7-query.txt"}~\\
\textbf{Output}~\\
\includegraphics[center]{"../Lesson 6/6_7_rowGrid"}~\\
~\\
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
In this exercise, we have omitted the Customer node, as we can use the Order node's 'customerID' attribute to find the result. 
~\\
We can see of the result that the customer with ID 'RATTC' has bought 9 of the same products as 'ALFKI' has bought. Thus 'RATTC' is the customer, which has bought most of the same products as 'ALFKI'. 

%-------------- Week 7 ---------------------
\section{Exercise 7.1}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Implement a Bloom Filter as a Python class. The class should have an add method which adds a string to the filter, and a lookup method which determines if a string is “in the filter”.}\\

\textbf{Overview}\\
For creating the bloom filter class we used the algorithm found at Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Algorithm_description}}.\\
We used a number of bits (m) of 1 million for the bit array, and an estimated number of distinct entries (n) of 235887 which are the number of entries in the dictionary file.
For finding the optimal number of hash functions we used the formula $\frac{m}{n} \cdot ln(2)$ which in our case gives us $2.938$ which we round up to next integer $3$.\\\\
In the add method we feed the element to each of our hash functions and set the indexes returned by them in our bitarray.\\\\
In the lookup method we check whether an element is present in our bloom filter by feeding the element to each of our hash functions. We use the indexes returned from the hash functions and get the bits at their positions in the bit array, if any of the bits at the indexes are 0, we know the element is not present in our bloom filter. If all the bits are 1 either the element is present or it is a false positive caused by collisions.\\\\
For finding each word in our texts we first needed to clean them. We converted the text to lower-case and split on the regex `\textbackslash W+' which gives us all words. We found we had to process the words even further as plural forms of words were present in the shakespeare text which was not the case in the dictionary thus yielding an error. To circumvent this we used a stemmer (Snowball Stemmer\footnote{\url{http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/snowball.html}}) to reduce the words to their word stem in both the dictionary and shakespeare text.\\
We defined two functions, one utilizing our BloomFilter class and one using the naive approach, this way we can benchmark them using the timeit module.\\

\textbf{Code}\\
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 7/bloom_filter.py"}
\textbf{Output}
\begin{pythonOutput}
5.115084372999263
85.1088753360018
132 words not in dictionary (in non bloom filter set) and 117 words not in dictionary (in bloom filter set), thus a false positive rate of 0.11363636363636365
words not in dictionary but reported to be:
licenc
ovid
seest
tis
ild
baser
speakest
diest
safest
truest
madmen
began
vii
drave
favour
\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
From the output we can see that using a bloom filter takes 5.115 seconds to add every dictionary word and do every lookup in the shakespeare text, and by doing it the naive way it takes 85.108 seconds, thus a speedup of ~16.638x, however we can also see the `penalty' of using a bloom filter as it reports 15 words as false positives (being in the dictionary when they are not).\\ Looking at the output of words we could probably reduce the number of words not in the dictionary even further as some of those words does exist in the dictionary just in another form, like safest and safe.

\section{Exercise 7.2}
\textbf{Short recap of the exercise}\\
\textit{Implement the Flajolet-Martin algorithm to determine the number of distinct words in this Shakespeare file.}\\

\textbf{Overview}\\
We have implemented the Flajolet-Martin algorithm using the algorithm found at Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flajolet-Martin_algorithm#The_algorithm}}.\\\\
The process method finds the index to set by calling the trailing\_zeroes and hash with the new entry.\\\\
The give\_estimate method finds the smallest index where the bitarray is 0 and estimates the cardinality with the correction factor $0.77351$.\\\\
The trailing\_zeroes method corresponds to the p function which outputs the position of the least significant 1-bit.\\\\

The class containing the algorithm takes a seed which is used in the hash function, this way we can use a different hash for each class created if we want to.
We run the algorithm several times to improve accuracy also described on Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flajolet-Martin_algorithm#Improving_accuracy}}, we create $K \cdot L$ instances of our class each with a random hash function and process each shakespeare word on every instance. Then for each $K$ we take the median of the $L$ estimates and lastly take the mean of each K median estimates.

\textbf{Code}\\
\pythonexternal{"../Lesson 7/flajolet_martin.py"}

\begin{pythonOutput}
K and L levels approximates:

\end{pythonOutput}
\textbf{Explanation of code and discussion}\\
We found the actual number of unique words to be 3171. We have tried to investigate how different levels of K and L affect the accuracy of the approximations. We have plotted the approximations for different levels of K and L (1-29) and the actual number of elements in Figure \ref{fig:flajolet_martin_plot}.\\
We have used symmetric levels of K and L as computations else would take too long. 
By looking at the plot we can see a huge outlier in the beginning but the approximations stabilize somewhat at higher levels, and 13 seems to be the best with an approximation of around 3156 ($13$ groups of $13$ approximations, thus $13^2=169$ hash functions).
